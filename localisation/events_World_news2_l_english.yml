World_news2.1.d:0 "Himmler hardened his gaze at the paper before him. Reflected from the white glare of the bunkers’ fluorescent lighting was a most peculiar image recovered from his American informants. The folder had arrived with a note, explaining that its contents contained an American super weapon that the degenerate Yankees had developed in utmost secrecy. What puzzled the SS commander, however, was that no blueprint or photographs were within the folder. Instead, what met his gaze was a facsimile of a common rodent, drawn with a gray coat, a smug yet foolish expression and an obese frame. He closed his eyes, his hands rubbing small circles around his temples. What secrets were the Americans withholding inside this drawing? Were his spies defecting, sending deliberately useless intelligence? Only two words adorned the page, and these rendered Heinrich even more irate than previously. Out loud, to nobody in particular, a single phrase was uttered."

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going."
